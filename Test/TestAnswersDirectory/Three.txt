ERRORS, REDUNDANCY, INEFFICIENCY
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1) line 2 : WHILE x < 1 AND x > 10 DO
        Error because x can not be both less than 1 and greater than 10 at the same time.
        This is a logical error and the while loop runs infinite time.

2) Line 5 : sum = sum + x
        Error because variable sum is not initialised.

3) line 7 : mean = sum / count
        Inefficiency because count is 0 which is integer. It will give run time error.
        This can be re-written in a different way to same job as original piece of code by replacing value of count to 0.0.
        This will be float and will output Infinity.

4) line 7 : mean = sum / count
        Error because variable mean is not initialised.
